        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Musa Sahe Jackiteh, a Computer Engineer and tech entrepreneur passionate about building impactful software solutions. I graduated from Cyprus West University in 2025 with a BSC in Computer Engineering. My journey into tech was shaped by resilience, curiosity, and the drive to solve real-world problems.

            Raised by a single mother who worked as a market vendor, I grew up understanding the struggles of small business owners and the need for innovation in everyday life. Born during the wake of the Liberian civil war, I have always been motivated to contribute to the rebuilding and transformation of Liberia through technology.
            
            I have served as the Student President for the Faculty of Engineering, where I led initiatives to improve student engagement in tech and innovation. I am also a fellow of the SMART Liberia EAd program, which has further strengthened my leadership and entrepreneurial skills.
            
            Currently, I am building a software startup that aims to provide innovative solutions for businesses, governments, NGOs, and educational institutions. My mission is to bridge the digital gap and empower organizations with cutting-edge technology.</p>
